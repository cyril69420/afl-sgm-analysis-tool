"""
Global configuration for the AFL SGM analysis tool. These values control
runtime defaults across ingestion scripts and may be overridden via CLI
arguments or environment variables. Settings are loaded from this file via
scripts/bronze/_shared.py::load_yaml().

Key sections include:

  seasons: A list of AFL seasons available for scraping. When omitted the
    current calendar year is used.
  default_rounds: Default rounds used when none are provided on the
    command line. Supports commaâ€‘separated values or ranges (e.g. "1-5").
  bookmakers: Enabled bookmakers. Used by bronze_discover_event_urls.
  weather:
    provider: Name of the weather provider used by the bronze weather
      ingestion scripts. The provider should be supported by the
      implementation in bronze_ingest_weather_*.
    api_key_env: Name of an environment variable holding the API key for
      the provider. If missing or empty the provider will be skipped.

You can add additional sections for other ingest steps as needed.
