"""
Configuration for bookmaker scraping. Each bookmaker entry defines the starting
URL for event discovery, CSS or XPath selectors used to locate event URLs,
pagination controls and any special instructions for navigating historical
fixtures. These values are consumed by the bronze_discover_event_urls script
and can be extended or adjusted without modifying the code.

The structure of this file is a mapping of bookmaker names to their
configuration. Keys include:

  start_url: The landing page used to initiate discovery. May include
    placeholders such as {season} or {round} which are filled by the CLI.
  event_selector: CSS selector that resolves to anchor elements for each
    event. Required.
  next_page_selector: Optional CSS selector for a pagination link or
    button that loads the next page of events.
  round_selector: Optional selector or description of a UI element used
    to navigate between rounds (for historical scraping). The bronze
    script interprets this based on the bookmakerâ€™s website structure.
  throttle_ms: Milliseconds to wait between page interactions. Scrapers
    should respect this to avoid overloading the site.

This file provides reasonable defaults for Sportsbet and PointsBet. Ladbrokes
is included as a placeholder and may require adjustments. Feel free to add
additional bookmakers following the same schema.
