"""
Configuration for bookmaker scraping.

Each bookmaker entry defines how the discovery and odds ingestion scripts
should interact with the website. The `start_url` is used to initiate
event discovery. CSS selectors identify event links and pagination
controls. `throttle_ms` introduces a polite delay between page
interactions. You can add additional fields (e.g. `fixture_selectors` or
api endpoints) as needed â€“ the scraping code reads keys dynamically.
