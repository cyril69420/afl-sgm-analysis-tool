Placeholder script for converting Bronze data to Silver.

This file exists solely to satisfy the repository structure during the
Bronze hardening pass. The actual logic for transforming raw data
into cleansed and enriched Silver tables should be implemented here in
future iterations. A minimal import of ``os`` is included to prevent
an ``UnboundLocalError`` that was observed in earlier versions.
